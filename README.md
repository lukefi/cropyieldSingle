# cropyieldSingle

This repository includes codes that are used to reshape histogram files from Sentinel-2 single image time series into analysis ready format and 
build neural network models to predict crop yield.

Here is a visual representation of the workflow:

## Python environment

Python version used is Python 3.8.6. The codes will probably also work on earlier versions as well. Tensorflow version used is 2.3.1.

The file requirements.txt may be used to create a virtual Python environment using:

conda create --name env_name --file requirements.txt

## processing

### 1. python/histo2stack.py

This code stacks all histogram files in a directory into one numpy array file.

RUN:

python histo2stack.py -i /Users/user/Documents/myCROPYIELD/scratch/project_2001253/histo_test1110_2016 -n 32 -o /Users/user/Documents/myCROPYIELD/dataStack -f test1110_2016.pkl 

WHERE:

-i is the input directory where are histograms in .csv files.

-n is the number of bins in histograms.

-o is the given output directory

-f is the given output filename

The programme will write results into output_dir_temp.

### 2. python/stack2ARD.py

This code stacks all numpy array files into one numpy array file. This programme finally converts data into machine learning ready format.

RUN:

python stack2ARD.py -o /Users/myliheik/Documents/myCROPYIELD/dataStack -f test1110 

WHERE:

-o is the output directory (same as previously for histo2stack.py)

-f is a characterizing name name of the data set

### 3. python/run3DNeuralNet.py

This code trains LSTMsingle and RNNsingle models and calculates predictions for a test set.
